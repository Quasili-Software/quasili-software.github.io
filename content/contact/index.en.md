## Note on our availability

At Quasili Consulting, we understand that each client's needs and timelines are unique.
Our availability is typically flexible and depends on the amount of work required.

For engineering work, we usually have a one or two month lead time.
This allows us to properly plan and allocate the necessary resources for your project.

However, we also understand that urgent matters may require a more immediate response.
In those cases, we're happy to work with you to accommodate shorter notice and get you the support you need as quickly as possible.

So whether you're planning a long-term project or need immediate assistance, you can count on us to be there for you. 

## Contact us

Do you want us to review your product? Do you need help doing due diligence on a system based on web3 technology or complex cryptographic schemes? Do you need a consultant to tell your management that their blockchain ambitions are a terrible idea?

**Contact us by email at [info@quasili.ch](mailto:info@quasili.ch) for all inquiries**.

All of our customers have also a direct phone number to reach their dedicated consultant when urgently needed.
