## Cryptographers for hire

Our professional cryptographers for hire offer a wide range of services to help you secure your digital assets and communications.

Our services include trainings and workshops, design review, and help with your architecture.
Whether you're developing a new system or want to improve the security of an existing one, we can help you identify vulnerabilities, evaluate your cryptographic protocols, and recommend best practices for implementation.

We can also work alongside your development team to perform the required code review to ensure that the code they implemented matches the relevant specifications or papers and is secure.

We have extensive experience with advanced cryptographic topics such as elliptic curve cryptography, multiparty computations, threshold schemes, digital signatures, hardware modules, and more. 
Whatever your needs, we can provide tailored solutions and advice to help you meet your specific requirements.

In addition to our comprehensive range of cryptographic services, we can also help you navigate the complex landscape of post-quantum cryptography. With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic protocols are at risk of being compromised, making it essential for organizations to start planning for a post-quantum future.

Our team of experts can help you assess your current cryptographic infrastructure and identify potential vulnerabilities. We can then work with you to develop a post-quantum transition plan that meets your specific needs and goals.

At Quasili Consulting, we are dedicated to helping our clients overcome their cryptographic challenges and achieve their security objectives.
