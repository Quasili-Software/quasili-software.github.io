Our availability is typically flexible and depends on the amount of work required.
For engineering work, we usually have a one or two month lead time. This allows us to properly plan and allocate the necessary resources for your project.
However, we also understand that urgent matters may require a more immediate response. In those cases, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to work with you to accommodate shorter notice and get you the support you need as quickly as possible.</description></item><item><title>Services</title><link>http://quasili.ch/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://quasili.ch/services/</guid><description>Do you want us to review your product?
